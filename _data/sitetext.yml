  about:
    title: "About Us"
    body: Olin Electric Motorsports is an undergraduate organization at Olin College focused on educating engineers through 
            the development and manufacture of electric vehicles. We believe that electric vehicles provide an excellent 
            platform for students to pursue mechanical, electrical, computer, and systems engineering in depth. By working 
            together to achieve this in time for competition, members also develop the communication and leadership skills 
            necessary for success as an engineer.<br><br>

    title: "Sponsor Us"
    text: "Our team relies on collaborative relationships with our sponsors"
    body: "Our team is entirely independently funded and relies on sponsorship from companies and groups to function 
          and fund our team’s development. There are many ways to support our team:<br><br><br>

          <b>Parts</b>: Your top-of-the-line parts will help complete a student designed racecar. Help us get an edge 
          on the competition.<br><br>
          <b>Cash</b>: Your cash contribution will help us purchase the tools and parts we need to design and build
          a competitive vehicle. You make this possible for us!<br><br>
          <b>Mentorship</b>: Your experience and advice will help guide the team to success. Design reviews with
          professionals are learning experiences for our members.<br><br>
          <b>Services</b>: You have capabilities we don’t. Help us make the advanced parts we don’t have the capability
          to make in house.<br><br><br>

          In exchange, our team has many benefits for sponsors including recruiting members from our team and being featured
          in our team’s marketing. More details for sponsorship can be found in our sponsorship package below and if you 
          have any questions, feel free to use the contact form.<br><br>
